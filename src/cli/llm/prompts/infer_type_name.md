Given the sample schema of a GraphQL type, suggest 5 meaningful names for it.
The name should be concise and preferably a single word.

The referenced_at contains the field names where this type is referenced and the reference_count is the number of times this type is referenced, use those as a context to generate the name

Example Input:
{{input}}

Example Output:
{{output}}

Ensure the output is in valid JSON format.

Do not add any additional text before or after the JSON.
